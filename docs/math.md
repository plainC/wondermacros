### W_ABS(a)
```C
a                    a value
```
    Use W_ABS to get the absolute value.
    
### W_MAX(...)
```C
...                  values to be compared (from one up to four)
```
    Use W_MAX to get the maximum of given values.
    
### W_MIN(...)
```C
...                  values to be compared (from one up to four)
```
    Use W_MIN to get the minimum of given values.
    
### W_SIGN(x)
```C
x                    a numeric value
```
    Use W_SIGN to get the sign of a number, i.g. -1 for negative, 0 for zero, and 1 for positive numbers.
