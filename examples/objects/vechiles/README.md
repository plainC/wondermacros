# An example using wobject tool

Run `make` to build the source code. `wobject` saves time since no boilerplate
code has to be maintained. Run `make test` to build objects and an executable.
The classes are generated using [this template](https://github.com/plainC/wondermacros/blob/master/examples/objects/vechiles/classes.wobject).
